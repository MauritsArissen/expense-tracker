## Expense Tracker

This project was made with [React](https://reactjs.org/). The learning purposes of making this project was to get familiar with React Hooks & Context API.

The beauty isn't sincerely in the front end but more in the back end. Feel free to play around with the project if you'd like.

### Why did I make this project

I am familiar working with [Angular](https://angular.io/). I've never worked with React before however I do find working with it very interesting.

### Demo

An herokuapp demo will be launched soon.
