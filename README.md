## Expense Tracker

This project was made with [React](https://reactjs.org/). The learning purposes of making this project was to get familiar with React Hooks & Context API.

The beauty isn't sincerely in the front end but more in the back end. Feel free to play around with the project if you'd like.

### Why did I make this project

I am familiar working with [Angular](https://angular.io/). I've never worked with React before however I do find working with it very interesting.

### Demo

The application demo is deployed on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and is using the free plan. If the website is inactive for 30 minutes it will shutdown and needs to restart. This wouldn't take much time but keep that in mind.
